save-a-selfie
=============

Save-a-Selfie is a campaign run by the Dublin Fire Brigrade to increase the awareness of Automated External Defibrillators in the general public. The campaign itself is still in the planning stages, but the idea is that users are encouraged to take selfies with an AED and post it, either using the campaign's mobile app or the web site - both generating awareness and populating a database with the locations of AEDs.

The Code for Ireland initiative (http://www.codeforireland.com/) brought the developers and the Dublin Fire Brigade together. 


Project status
==============

iOS app: There is a basic working app that allows a user to upload pictures with a comment and shows the locations of AEDs in the database as pins on a map. More features are coming soon. It is not on the App Store yet.

Web site: Still under construction. It currently resides at http://gunfire.becquerel.org/save-a-selfie/.

We are planning to develop an Android app as well, but are focusing on the iOS app and the web interface first.
